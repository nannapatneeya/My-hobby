# My-hobby

Upgraded midterm project for **Tables, Forms & Multimedia** with an integrated JavaScript mini-game.

## Pages
- `home.html` — project landing page and integrated Rock–Paper–Scissors game.
- `reviews.html` — improved review table (header/footer rows + zebra striping) and poster highlights.
- `about.html` — multimedia section and improved recommendation form.

## Tech
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- External stylesheet (`styles.css`)
- Shared JavaScript (`script.js`) for game logic and form feedback
